            <p>Junior Web Developer</p>
            <p>
              Hey there! I'm a front-end web developer who's all about creating
              user-friendly online experiences. I started out in customer
              service, but I've since graduated from the Junior Full Stack
              Developer program at IT Career Switch. Right now, I'm leveling up
              my coding skills at Skills Bootcamp's Front-End Web Development
              course on edX Boot Camp. <br />I love tackling problems and coming
              up with cool new apps, especially ones that prioritize mobile
              users. By combining my past experiences with my ongoing education,
              I'm ready to dive into a role where I can bring fresh ideas to the
              table and make a real impact in the tech world. <br />
              With a solid background in business management and web
              development, I'm ready to take on any challenge and thrive in a
              fast-paced, always-changing environment. Let's build something
              awesome together!
